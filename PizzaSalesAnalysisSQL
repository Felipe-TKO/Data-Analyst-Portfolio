-- 1. Queries for # of customers per day & Peak hours

-- # of customer per day for the whole year
Select count(order_id) as Total_number_of_Customers, cast(date as date) as Date
From orders 
Group by date
Order by Date

-- Show peak hours (using DATEPART to show the Hour)
Select count(order_id) as Total_number_of_Customers, DATEPART(HOUR, time) AS time_of_day 
FROM orders 
Group By time
Order By Total_number_of_Customers Desc, Time

-- Date of max number of customers
Select count(order_id) as Total_number_of_Customers, cast(date as date) as Date
From orders 
Group by date
Order by Total_number_of_Customers Desc
OFFSET 0 ROWS FETCH FIRST 1 ROWS ONLY;

-- 2. # of pizzas in an order & best selling pizzas (Small insights)
-- Join the order_details with pizzas with pizza types.. 
-- or create a new subtable with pizzatypes so pizza name is with pizzas table

-- Query for # of pizzas in an order (Quanitty group by order ID)
SELECT order_id, count(quantity) as Number_of_pizzas 
FROM order_details
Group by order_id
Order BY Number_of_pizzas Desc;

-- Challenge query number of order by number of pizzas (Sub Query solution)
Select count(order_id)as Count_of_orders, Number_of_pizzas 
	From 
		(
			SELECT order_id, count(quantity) as Number_of_pizzas
			FROM order_details
			Group by order_id ) order_details
	Group by Number_of_pizzas
	Order By Count_of_orders DESC;


-- Query for best selling pizza (this is showing per ordered quantity.. maybe not accurate query on best selling pizza)

--2nd query on best sellig pizza (Sum of the quantity by grouped by pizza_Id <- more accurate)

-- 3. Total Revenue & Seasonanilty in sales (Do it by quarters) (Big insight)
-- (Quantity of products sold * the cost of sale) sum total sales


-- This Query groups the total cost by the pizza id so we see how much of each pizza was sold
Select

From order_details od
Join pizzas p on od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id

-- Quick query to show total revenue
SELECT SUM(od.quantity * p.price) AS total_revenue
FROM Order_details od
JOIN pizzas p ON od.pizza_id = p.pizza_id

-- By Quarter
select o.date , Sum(od.quantity * p.price) as Revenue
